Majestic ancient oak tree in the middle of a serene meadow, bathed in the golden light of a setting sun. The tree's gnarled branches stretch out wide, adorned with vibrant green leaves that rustle gently in the breeze. A soft mist hovers around the roots, enhancing the mystical atmosphere. Captured in ultra-high-definition with photorealistic detail, the scene is reminiscent of a painting by the old masters, with rich textures and dynamic shadows creating a sense of depth and tranquility.
